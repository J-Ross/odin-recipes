    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Large egg whites</li>
            <li>Orange or lemon zest</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Almond flavoring</li>
            <li>Powdered/icing sugar</li>
            <li>Almond flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the mixer add the egg whites, zest, vanilla, almond flavoring and combine, then add the sugar, flour, salt and baking powder, combine with either a wooden spoon or beat with flat beaters on low speed until a soft and compact dough forms.</li>
            <li>Move the dough to a clean bowl, cover in plastic and refrigerate for 12-24 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 325F (160F). Line 1-2 cookies sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the fridge, place the dough on a flat surface that has been liberally sprinkled with powdered sugar (extras) roll the dough to form an approximate 21 inch (55 cm) log, cut into ½ inch (1.2 cm) slices, and shape into an oval, place them on the prepared cookie sheets. Dust the slices well with the remaining powdered sugar. While the oven is pre-heating, allow the cookies to sit at room temperature for 10 – 15 minutes on the cookie sheets to dry out a bit before baking them.</li>
            <li>Bake for approximately 15-18 minutes. Gently and carefully with a spatula remove the cookies immediately to a wire rack to cool completely. They will be soft at first but when cooled will become the perfect chewy consistency. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
